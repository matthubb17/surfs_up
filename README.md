# surfs_up

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to pull weather data for Hawaii to determine if it is a good location to open a surf and shake shop which will sell both surf boards and ice cream to tourists and locals. I need some investor backing from W. Avy, so I will need to use the weather data in order to make sure that Oahu is the ideal location to open a surf shop.

## Resources:

**Sqlite File:** [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/matthubb17/surfs_up/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite)

**Challenge File:** [SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/matthubb17/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb)

**Software:** Python 3.9.7, SQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook, and Flask

## Results:

- As we can see from the dataframes below, there is not a large variance between average temperatures for Oahu in June and December. We saw an average temperature of 75 degrees in June vs. a 71 degrees average in December. This means that Oahu is an ideal place for a surf and ice cream shop as it is never too cold for a fresh scoop of ice cream.

![Dec Temps](https://github.com/matthubb17/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec%20Temps%20DF.JPG)

- When looking at the minimum temperatures there is also not a large variance between the two months. The min for June is 64 degrees vs. a min of 56 degrees in December.

- When looking at the maximum temperatures June has a max of 85 degrees and December has a max of 83 degrees.

## Summary:

When considering the results it looks like Oahu is the ideal place to open up a Surf and Ice Cream shop. The max and min temperatures throughout the year are rather warm, and are also favorable for water activities.

If I was to look to expand on the data that we have collected to get more information on Oahu weather I would think it makes sense to look at the amount of percipitation that the area recieved throughout the year to better pinpoint the best times for customers to get out on the waves. In addition, I would recommend that we pull info regarding sunrise and sunset in order to get a better feel for the best operating hours for the shop.
