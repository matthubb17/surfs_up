# surfs_up

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to pull weather data for Hawaii to determine if it is a good location to open a surf and shake shop which will sell both surf boards and ice cream to tourists and locals. I need some investor backing from W. Avy, so I will need to use the weather data in order to make sure that Oahu is the ideal location to open a surf shop.
