# surfs_up

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to pull weather data for Hawaii to determine if it is a good location to open a surf and shake shop which will sell both surf boards and ice cream to tourists and locals. I need some investor backing from W. Avy, so I will need to use the weather data in order to make sure that Oahu is the ideal location to open a surf shop.

## Resources:

**Sqlite File:** [hawaii.sqlite](https://github.com/matthubb17/surfs_up/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite)

**Software:** Python 3.9.7, SQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook, and Flask

## Results:

- As we can see from the chart below, there is a large number of employees that are eligable for retirement. We can see that over 32,000 staff are eligable along with over 8,000 senior staff.

Within this challenge we used the ETL function to collect and clean the various data that was available to us listed above. We then worked through the data to load it and update an existing PostgreSQL tables.
